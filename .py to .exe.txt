You've just made a beautiful GUI app with Python - but there's a big difference between creating an app for your personal use and distributing it all across the web, reaching many people who don't necessarily know anything about Python. 
In this tutorial, I will show you exactly how to convert your Tkinter, Kivy, KivyMD, PyQT5, or other GUIs into a full-blown professional program! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
The end result is a ðŸ˜± SINGLE SETUP FILE ðŸ˜± which anyone can download and install on their computer - even your grandmom!!! ðŸ‘µ
We will use Pyinstaller to create an executable file and Inno Setup to bundle it with dependencies and convert them into a setup wizard. 
In addition, we will discuss some common errors, how to fix them and how to avoid irrelevant instructions (hint: do we really need to modify the SPEC file? ðŸ¤”)
We will briefly tackle licensing (open source, as you may guess ðŸ˜‰), and generating icons.
Please note, this video is designed for Windows developers and users! However, I will cover Linux and Mac as well in some future tutorials... the Mac tutorial is of course inspired by Tom! XDD (but only members of our Discord community will understand the joke, this is how I test if they read video descriptions ðŸ˜…) 


This is an very extensive, deep and detail information created by me  -  Arinjay Kumar.
This took me a lot of hours.
This was a very painful and time taking thing project.




For converting .py file to an .exe(executable file).
* Includes the way for making your own setup process for your .exe file *
Please follow the instructions carefully and properly:-

Point to note :-
* There may be some or many problems or issues related to information, etc. in this .txt file.

1.) PYINSTALLER (Jokingly known as  -  Mother of Auto Py)

2.) Auto Py


* USING PYINSTALLER METHOD *
* Requires you to have pip already installed on your computer. *
* As per a windows user * 
* May work in MAC or LINUX, etc *
* Not tested *
* It will work properly even if the .py file has - python app, sqlite DB(Database), .png images, tt fonts etc and .py packages like - Tkinter, Kivy, KivyMD, PyQT5, or other GUI packages.
* Highly not recommended for business. *
* Only recommended for personal use. *
